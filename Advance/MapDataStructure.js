// -> Keys can be of any data type: Unlike objects , where keys are limited to string and symbols , Map allows you  to use any data type as keys , including numbers  , booleans , objects , and even other map instancse.

//-> Maintains insertions order: Map preserves the order of key-value pairs as they were inserted , while objects keys may not be guaranteed to be in a specific order.
// ->Iteration: Map provides buit-in methods for easy iteration over its elements.
